## Free service

Prikkert is a free service provided by Quinten Coret ([prikkert@qntn.io](mailto:prikkert@qntn.io)). The source code is [open source](https://codeberg.org/qcoret/prikkert), released for reuse under the [European Union Public License](https://codeberg.org/qcoret/prikkert/src/branch/main/LICENSE). The goal is for the service to always remain free of charge and ad-free for users.

## Personal data

Prikkert only processes the personal data necessary to enable the scheduling of a group appointment ([performance of a contract](https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/themes/basic-gdpr/gdpr-basics/legal-bases-from-the-gdpr-explained#legal-basis-of-contract)).

The organizer of an appointment provides a title and date options, and can choose to add a name and description. A participant provides a name and their availability per date option.

You do not need an account. Prikkert does not process email addresses or passwords.

## Cookies

Prikkert only uses [functional cookies](https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/themes/internet-and-smart-devices/cookies) to make the service work. Because of this, no cookie banner is required.

Your session as an organizer or participant is stored in a cookie. As a result, you can only edit your appointment or availability via the device and browser you originally used.

The organizer can choose to share the management of the appointment via a link with other devices, browsers, or people.

## Visibility

By default, Prikkert shares the name and availability of participants with anyone who has the link to an appointment.

The organizer can choose to hide participants' responses. The responses will then only be visible to administrators of the appointment. Additionally, the organizer can also allow anonymous responses.

## Third parties

Your personal data is never sold. Data is not shared with third parties, except with the hosting service or if legally required.

You are not tracked in any way. Prikkert does not use profiling or automated decision-making.

## Retention

Prikkert runs on the infrastructure of Hetzner Online GmbH, with whom a [data processing agreement](https://www.hetzner.com/AV/DPA_en.pdf) has been concluded. Data is always processed within the European Union.

Data is kept no longer than necessary. An appointment and all associated responses are automatically deleted three months after the appointment's final date option.

## Security

The developer takes appropriate measures against misuse, loss, and unauthorized access.

To secure Prikkert, logs containing the IP addresses of requests are kept ([legitimate interest](https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/themes/basic-gdpr/gdpr-basics/legal-bases-from-the-gdpr-explained#legal-basis-of-legitimate-interest)). Logs containing IP addresses are retained for a maximum of one month.

## Rights

[Under the GDPR](https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/themes/basic-gdpr/privacy-rights-under-the-gdpr), you have the right to information, access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, and data portability. Prikkert attempts to facilitate these rights as well as possible through the website.

If this doesn't work, please contact [prikkert@qntn.io](mailto:prikkert@qntn.io). You also have the right to file a complaint with the [Dutch Data Protection Authority](https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/submitting-a-tip-off-or-a-complaint-to-the-ap).

## Changes

Prikkert may amend this privacy policy. The full version history of the policy is available on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/qcoret/prikkert).
